Web Store eCommerce solution for Lightspeed

Please note that this is a public repo designed to aid developers on what has changed from version to version.

This repo only receives one commit per version which is a combined (squashed) commit of changes from the prior version.

Developers are welcome to post Issues here, but please be advised this forum is not considered part of our active support (although we do monitor it and try to update as time allows). Immediate technical support should always go through http://my.lightspeedretail.com. Issues posted here should be very specific to the code, not general support.
