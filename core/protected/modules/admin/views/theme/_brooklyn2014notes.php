	<h4>Brooklyn 2014 uses Web Store's new Integrated Cart & Checkout.</h4>
	<p>The new checkout process does not support a few web store settings detailed below. If these settings are critical
	   to your online store please delay switching to this theme until we're able to support these settings
	   within our new checkout process.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Store Settings &gt; Customer Registration Require Account Creation</strong> - the new checkout allows customers to create an account<br>
		after confirming their order - considered a best practice in encouraging ecommerce conversion.</li>
		<li><strong>Payments &gt; Set Display Order</strong> - currently payment options are ordered as: PayPal (if enabled), credit card payment provider and<br>
		then any other payment options are listed below in alphabetical order.</li>
		<li><strong>Shipping &gt; Set Display Order</strong> - shipping options are listed in order from least to most expensive.</li>
		<li><strong>Shipping &gt; Global Settings &gt; Delivery Speed Format</strong> - delivery speed format is always displayed as "price label"</li>
	</ul>
	<br>
	<p>There are also new Store Address fields to fill in. Please navigate to <strong>Store Settings &gt; Store Information</strong>
	and update your Store address.</p>
